\section{Joint PDFs and CDFs}

\subsection*{Joint Distributions}
The \textbf{joint CDF} of $X$ and $Y$ is 
$$F(x,y)=P(X \leq x, Y \leq y)$$
In the discrete case, $X$ and $Y$ have a \textbf{joint PMF} 
$$p_{X,Y}(x,y) = P(X=x,Y=y).$$ In the continuous case, they have a \textbf{joint PDF}
\[f_{X,Y}(x,y) = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x \partial y} F_{X,Y}(x,y).\]
The joint PMF/PDF must be nonnegative and sum/integrate to 1.
\subsection*{Marginal Distributions}
To find the distribution of one (or more) random variables from a joint PMF/PDF, sum/integrate over the unwanted random variables. \medskip

\textbf{Marginal PMF from joint PMF}
\[P(X = x) = \sum_y P(X=x, Y=y)\]
\textbf{Marginal PDF from joint PDF}
\[f_X(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f_{X, Y}(x, y) dy\]


\subsection*{Independence of Random Variables}
Random variables $X$ and $Y$ are independent if and only if any of the following conditions holds:
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep -1mm
    \item Joint CDF is the product of the marginal CDFs 
    \item Joint PMF/PDF is the product of the marginal PMFs/PDFs
    \item Conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X$ is the marginal distribution of $Y$
\end{itemize}
