\section{SLLN}
    \subsection*{Def}
    The Strong Law of Large Numbers states that if $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ are i.i.d r.v. with finite mean $\mu$, then the sample mean $\bar{X}_n$ converges almost surely to $\mu$ as $n$ approaches infinity, i.e.,
    \[
    P\left(\lim_{{n \to \infty}}\frac{X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_n}{n} = \mu \right) = 1
    \]

    WLLN does not imply SLLN. SLLN implies WLLN.
